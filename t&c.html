              By completing and submitting an electronic order form, you are
              making an offer to purchase goods which, if accepted by us, will
              result in a binding contract. Please note that products will not
              be sent (or links to online products) until we have authorization
              from your payment card issuer. We will not be liable if there is a
              delay, and we will not accept your order if payment is not
              authorized.
            </p>

            After you have placed your order: You will receive an email to
            acknowledge your order. It will confirm which products you have
            ordered. This email is not an order acceptance from us. When an
            order for downloadable e-books, audios, or other downloadable
            products has been placed, you will be redirected to a �thank you�
            page which will require you to verify your name and email address.
            Once that information has been verified, you will be redirected to a
            download page which will allow you to download the purchased
            content. You will also receive an email containing the link to the
            download page. We do not have to accept your order, and for example,
            we will not accept your order if: We do not have the products in
            stock

              the product after receiving it, contact us for return of the
              payment price, as indicated in the guarantee. Pricing and payment
              Prices throughout the website are quoted in U.S. dollars, and
              payment can only be accepted in U. S. Dollars. Packing and
              delivery costs, if any, will be added to the total price of your
              purchase. While we make every effort to ensure that the products
              shown on our website are currently available at the price shown,
              we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. If products
              you have ordered are unavailable, you will be notified as soon as
              possible. The price you pay is the price of the products shown at
              the time you place your order, even if the price of the product
              has since changed. Your payment card will be debited for your

              Ease Consulting will be raised with or adjudicated by the credit
              card company. Rather, you agree to contact Legal Ease Consulting,
              Inc. directly to resolve the issue or obtain a refund pursuant to
              the product guarantee. Where an offer mentions that an item is
              reduced in price, eg: half-price, the discount will be calculated
              at checkout before any postage or packaging charges are applied.
